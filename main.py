    # 1. Build two trees -- one will store the possible_words and the other will store the correct answers.

    # 2. Traverse both trees - store the results AND output how many elements belong to each list

    # 3. Allow the user to input a prefix that they would like to search both trees for.

    # 4. Print the results of both searches -- make sure to add context to make it clear which results are from which
    #    tree

    # 5. Using word_starts_with, print all of the words that start with 'ha' from each list

    # 6. Remove all of the correct answers from the possible words tree
    #    (i.e., The possible words tree should now just hold incorrect answers.)

    # 7. Using word_starts_with, print both the possible correct answers that begin with 'ha' and the words that
    #    begin with 'ha' that CANNOT be correct answers.
